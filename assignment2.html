        I am a recent graduate student at University of Commerce. My major is Business Administration. I have spent  three years improving my skill in Marketing.<br/>
        I am the final year student who has spent 4 years during my university time studying hard and improving my skills in Accounting.<br/>
        Last years, I participated in an internship at a marketing agency, and it taught me analytic, social media skills. This internship fits well with this Marketing position because I had an experience to work in an professional environment, as well as had basic knowledge about Marketing.<br/>
        Last years, I participated in a Green Summer Volunteer Campaign at my university, and it taught me teamwork skill. This experience fits well with this coordinartor position because I had an experience to work with disadvantaged children, as well as knew how to coordinate the volunteers.<br/>
        I’m interested in ABC because I can demonstrate my skills in Teamwork, soft skills I am excellent at and I can contribute these strength to  your projects.<br/>
        I have been a Marketing executive at ADT. My main task is to manage the whole Marketing activities.<br/>
        Before that, I worked at an agency where I worked with three different big educational brands.<br/>
        Before that, I worked at  ADT company where I worked with many partners from many countries in the world.<br/>
        And while I really enjoyed the work that I did, I’d love to change to have a new challenge in my career, which is why I ‘m so excited about this opportunity with Company ADT<br/></p>
